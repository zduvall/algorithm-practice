/**
 * Balanced Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: true


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104

/**
* Definition for a binary tree node.
* function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
*     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
*     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
*     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
* }
*/
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {boolean}
 */

// had to look at a solution online

// basically, if the difference between left and right is ever more than one, 
// return infinity on that stack and return the max overall in the end (which would
// be infinity if any node was ever unbalanced).
// If the answer becomes infinity then the whole tree is false

const isBalanced = function (root) {

    let dfs = function (node) {
        if (!node) return -1;
        let left = 1 + dfs(node.left);
        let right = 1 + dfs(node.right);
        if (Math.abs(left - right) > 1) return Infinity;
        return Math.max(left, right);
    }
